# SQL Injection Exploit Explaning

This Python script demonstrates an advanced SQL Injection attack on a vulnerable web application. It exploits unsanitized user input in a login form and shows how attackers can bypass authentication or retrieve sensitive information.

## Overview

SQL injection is one of the most common web application vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit unsanitized user inputs to manipulate SQL queries and gain unauthorized access to the database. This script demonstrates a basic SQL Injection attack using Python, which can be used on a vulnerable web application.

## How to Use

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Make sure you have the `requests` library installed:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. **Set Target URL:**
   - Replace the placeholder URL in the script (`http://example.com/login`) with the URL of the vulnerable login page of your target web application.

3. **Configure Payload:**
   - The script uses a default SQL Injection payload: 
     ```python
     sql_injection_payload = "' OR 1=1 --"
     ```
   - This payload is used to bypass authentication. You can modify it as needed depending on the vulnerability in the application.

4. **Running the Script:**
   - Once you have configured the URL and payload, you can run the script using:
   ```bash
   python sql_injection_exploit.py
   ```

## Expected Output

- **SQL Injection Attempt (Initial Test):**
   - The script will first test the basic SQL Injection. If successful, it will output:
     ```
     SQL Injection successful! Logged in as user: ' OR 1=1 --
     ```
   - If the injection fails, it will output:
     ```
     SQL Injection failed. No login.
     ```

- **Brute Force Attempt:**
   - If the basic SQL Injection fails, the script will try brute-forcing the username field with numeric user IDs (1000-9999). On success, it will output:
     ```
     SQL Injection successful! User ID: 1001
     ```

   - If no valid user is found, the script will continue attempting different usernames.

## Limitations

- This script assumes the vulnerable web application does not have protection mechanisms such as rate limiting, CAPTCHA, or other intrusion prevention systems.
- Replace `Welcome` in the response check with the actual success message from your target application.

## Disclaimer

- **This script is intended for educational purposes only.**
- Use this script **only on web applications you own or have explicit permission to test**.
- Unauthorized testing or exploiting of vulnerabilities is illegal and unethical.
