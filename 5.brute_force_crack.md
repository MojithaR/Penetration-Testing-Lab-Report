### **Explanation of the Code:**

- **Function: `brute_force_ssh`**
  - This function attempts to brute-force SSH login by trying every combination of a given set of characters for a specific username and password length.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `ip`: Target IP address of the SSH server.
    - `port`: SSH port (default 22).
    - `username`: The username to try.
    - `password_length`: The length of the password to try (default is 4).
    - `use_uppercase`: Whether to include uppercase letters in the brute-force attempts.
    - `use_special_chars`: Whether to include special characters in the brute-force attempts.
    - `delay`: Time delay between login attempts to avoid rate-limiting protection.
  
- **Character Set**:
  - By default, the script uses lowercase letters and digits. If needed, you can extend it to include uppercase letters or special characters.
  
- **Brute Force Loop**:
  - The script uses `itertools.product` to generate every possible combination of the allowed characters for the given password length.
  - It attempts to connect using **paramiko.SSHClient()** and checks if the connection succeeds with the given password.
  - If successful, it will print the correct password and exit the loop.
  
- **Error Handling**:
  - The script catches `paramiko.AuthenticationException` for failed login attempts and continues trying the next password.
  - It also handles other exceptions to stop the script if there are unexpected errors.

- **Delay**:
  - A small delay (`time.sleep(delay)`) is added between attempts to prevent detection by brute-force prevention mechanisms.

# Brute Force SSH Password Cracking Script

This Python script demonstrates how an attacker might perform a brute-force attack on an SSH login or any service with weak password protections. It uses the **paramiko** library to attempt to connect to the SSH service and guesses passwords based on a specified character set and length.

## Overview

Brute-force password cracking is one of the simplest but most effective methods for exploiting weak password protection. This script attempts to connect to a remote SSH server using various combinations of characters for the password. 

## How to Use

### 1. **Install Required Libraries**

Before running the script, ensure you have the required library, `paramiko`, installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install paramiko
```

### 2. **Configure the Target IP Address, Port, and Username**

In the script, you need to set:
- **`ip`**: The target IP address of the SSH server you wish to test.
- **`port`**: The port number (default is 22 for SSH).
- **`username`**: The username you are attempting to crack the password for.

```python
brute_force_ssh('192.168.1.100', 22, 'admin')
```

### 3. **Set the Password Length and Character Set**

The script will attempt passwords of a specified length and can include:
- **Lowercase letters**
- **Uppercase letters** (if enabled)
- **Digits**
- **Special characters** (if enabled)

To include uppercase and special characters, you can modify the function call like this:

```python
brute_force_ssh('192.168.1.100', 22, 'admin', password_length=4, use_uppercase=True, use_special_chars=True)
```

### 4. **Running the Script**

Once the parameters are configured, you can run the script using:

```bash
python brute_force_crack.py
```

### Expected Output

- If the password is found successfully, the script will print:
  ```
  Password found: [password]
  ```
  - For example, if the password is `admin1234`, it will output:
  ```
  Password found: admin1234
  ```

- If the password is incorrect for all attempted combinations, the script will continue attempting until it exhausts all possibilities. If there is an error (such as connection failure), the script will print the error and stop:
  ```
  Error: [error_message]
  ```

### Customization

- **Password Length**: You can change the length of the password by modifying the `password_length` parameter.
- **Character Set**: To adjust the characters used for the brute force, modify `use_uppercase` and `use_special_chars` to `True` or `False` based on your needs.
- **Delay Between Attempts**: You can adjust the `delay` parameter to slow down the attack, which may help avoid detection by brute-force defense systems.

## Important Considerations

- **Ethical Use**: Only use this script on systems you have permission to test.
- **Security**: Ensure the target system is secured with strong password policies and employs mechanisms to detect and block brute force attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Systems with rate-limiting may block IP addresses after a number of failed login attempts. Consider using proxies or VPNs for testing, but always stay ethical.

## Disclaimer

This script is intended for educational and ethical use only. Do not use this on systems that you do not have explicit permission to test.
